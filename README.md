# Portfolio

This repository contains all the necessary files to run my portfolio website. The `docs` folders contains all the HTML, CSS and JavaScript code needed to make the website functional, the `images` folder contains all the images used in the website and the `other` folders contains other files that are needed in the website.

**Note:** The projects page is a bit finicky and doesn't always show the content the way I intended it to. If the page appears to have two columns, refresh the page and it should show all the projects and the summary below it.
