                <p>
                    As the final project for my web design class, we were asked to use our skills in HTML and CSS to
                    create a website about anything we wanted. I chose to create a travel website about one of Japan’s
                    prefectures, Nagano. The circumstances under which this website was created was ideal in that I
                    already had a lot of researched information about Nagano because of a presentation I previously
                    did about the prefecture. View the website <a href="https://kelliannr.github.io/hs-final-project/">here</a>!

                <h5><strong>Where:</strong> Figmathon 2022</h5>
                <p>
                    Figmathon was a UX design hackathon that aimed to bring together people with diverse skill sets to
                    develop creative solutions that empower and uplift us into a brighter and more equitable future. The 
                    theme was “Design the future,” which encouraged participants to think about what we would want an 
                    equitable future to look like (Most of the information here was taken from the Figmathon website. 
                    View it <a href="https://figmathon.netlify.app/">here</a> ). This hackathon had three main tracks to
                    guide our topic selection. The tracks were health, nature and social, but we were not limited to these
                    three.

                    The issue my team chose was how difficult it can be for the disabled to move around the UW Seattle campus.
                    This is made harder by the fact that the campus is stair heavy and that the accessible-friendly paths 
                    can be fairly hidden. We decided to solve the problem by creating a prototype of an app that functions 
                    similarly to Google Maps, but takes into account where the stairs are and only shows accessible-friendly 
                    routes to the desired destination. This app would save the trouble of trying to remember where alternative 
                    routes are and guessing how much extra time would be needed to take the accessible route. My team was one
                    of the nine finalists! View our Figma prototype <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/Ud5y2Sjh0OkULtUeJabdNB/Disability-Access-App?node-id=21%3A22&page-id=0%3A1&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=21%3A22">here</a>!

                <p>
                    People around the world are listening to more international artists. Current streaming services like
                    Spotify and Apple Music make it difficult for listeners to discover international artists from different
                    genres and countries. DiscGlobe highlights artists from around the world, helping to create a more
                    inclusive and diverse music streaming experience!
                </p>
                <p>
                    DiscGlobe allows users to discover music from places around the world! When users create an account, 
                    they are prompted to take a <i>Music Profile Quiz</i> where they describe their music taste. DiscGlobe 
                    is then able to recommend music based on their answers. DiscGlobe allows users to find music by searching 
                    for a specific place or searching by a variety of filters. On their profile, users are able to customize 
                    the colors used on the app, view music they’ve recently listened to, view a summary of music they’ve 
                    played, and update or retake their quiz answers. View our Figma prototype <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/0cWQ45Smh1hXDiujw2f5m3/Hackathon-Project?node-id=51%3A144&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=51%3A144">here</a>!
